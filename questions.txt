 - For the alteranate constructor should I check if the index you're trying to 
   add the sub in, is within the storeSubs[] length or not. I was thinking of
   a case where you keep the programming running for an extremely long time or 
   that will never happen because we're only ever modifying the copy constructoe

- in terms of comminting, is they are limit on how long the comments should be,
  and who do we assume we're writting comments for, who do I assume the programming
  skills of the reader to be? Or are we writing comments to show that we 
  understand something
